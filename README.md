# DevTools
#### Chrome DevTools is a set of developers tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. 
## In video below I used Chrome DevTools to demonstrate possibilities provided for testing, including but not limited to: inspecting elements, viewing HTTP Requests and Responses, simulating bad internet connections, emulating device settings as well as diferent geographical locations. Steps are also described.
