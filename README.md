# DevTools
#### Chrome DevTools is a set of developers tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. 
In <a href="https://github.com/DariaMartinovskaya/DevTools/blob/main/DevTools_HW.md" target="_blank">this video</a> I used Chrome DevTools to demonstrate possibilities provided for testing, including but not limited to: 
- inspecting elements
- viewing HTTP Requests and Responses
- simulating poor internet connections
- emulating device settings
- emulating diferent geographical locations

Steps are also described.
